# About This Repository :

This repository focuses on the diffrent data science and machine learning projects that i have worked on using many diffrent machine learing models from basic classification and regression up to more complex models like decision trees and random forest, i have used diffrent data vizulization techniques, and had to deal with data cleaning and preprocessing using various diffrent techniques like standerdization and log-transformation and ofcourse dealing with missing values and many other skills were used so check it out.
